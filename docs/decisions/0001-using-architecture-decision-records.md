# Using Architecture Decision Records

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2023-02-10

## Context and Problem Statement
This is a very early stage of the project and I'm considering development processes that will prove to be beneficial over time.

## Consequences
At the cost of a little friction in the design/refactor process I will a) get into a good habit and b) have a tracker for reference in the future

## Decision
Use ADRs 
Don't use ADRs

## Considered Options

* Use ADRs
* Don't use ADRs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use ADRs", because they can't really hurt
